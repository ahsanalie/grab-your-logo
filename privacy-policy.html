        </div>        
        <div class="PrivacyPolicy">
          <p>At The Grab Your Logo, the privacy of our clients is our top priority on www.elitedesignhub.com, and we regard it as our own. Although we gather information from our clients, the purpose is to improve our customer services. Our company acknowledges that the maintenance and use of our client's data is our responsibility. We DO NOT rent or sell our clients' information online.</p>
          <p>This policy describes how the personal information of our client collected by us is used, why we collect it, and how we use it. We describe the choices you can make about collecting and using your information within our approach.</p>
          <span>Personal Information Collected</span>
          <p>The information collected by The Grab Your Logo includes the client's name, email, mailing address, and phone number. These are pieces of information that the client provides us while ordering or saving our company's data. We may also use the email addresses or mailing addresses that we receive through our mailing system, such as our Contact Us Form, to respond to comments and queries.
Our company also maintains records of the items that have interested our clients in the past and the client's purchases online.</p>
          <span>Use of Collected Data</span>
          <p>The information collected is used in many diversified methods. Our company uses the information saved by our clients to process their orders. The emails are also routed to confirm the order. Our customer services may also contact them via phone, mailing address, or email if our company has other queries regarding the order placed.
          As a client, one might also receive updates regarding our Site and services, including a newsletter and information on promotions. Besides, we may also use the information about your interests and purchases to improve our site design and the client's purchasing experience.
          </p>
          <span>Newsletter Opt-out</span>
          <p>Suppose you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications. In that case, you may cancel receiving them anytime by following the instructions included in each newsletter or by email request; you can also call us at <a href="tel:+1737263-0237">+1 (737) 263-0237</a> / <a href="tel:+17139221311">+1 (713) 922-1311</a>. Social Media (Features) and Widgets</p>
          <p>Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button [and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Site]. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
          <span>3rd Party Sharing</span>
          <p>Personal information will not be released to third parties unless described in this policy. There are no circumstances under which we sell personal information to third parties.
          We use credit card processing companies to bill you for services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. We also use Live Person to provide live customer support chat on our website. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>
          <span>Security of Personal Information</span>
          <p>The information of our clients is secure, as it is protected during transmission by the use of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software which encrypts the information the client puts in.
          We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions about our website's security, you can send an email to us at <a href="mailto:support@elitedesignhub.com">support@elitedesignhub.com</a> / <a href="mailto:info@elitedesignhub.com">info@elitedesignhub.com</a>.</p>
          <span>Access to Registered Accounts</span>
          <p>The client can access their registered accounts by signing in on our homepage. Once signed in, the client has access to their previous lists and information that they have already submitted to the Site. The users can update their information once they have logged in to their accounts by clicking My Account.
          Changing & Deleting/Unsubscribing Accounts
          The client has to send in an email to cancel the subscription or delete their personal information. The unsubscription shall preclude the user from receiving emails related to any online order they might have placed at the Site.
          </p>
          <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. Please contact us if you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
          <span>Cookies and Their Use</span>
          <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers transferred to the clients' hard drives through their Web browsers. This enables our systems to recognize the clients' browsers and store items in their Shopping Carts during visits.</p>
          <p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will help explain how to prevent the browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify the user when a new cookie is received, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of the top features at our Site. Our company recommends that the client leave them to be accepted.</p>
          <p>Second, we keep track of your IP address to help diagnose our server's problems and administer our website. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information about you, such as your location and your Internet service provider. We may also collect combined information on how our users utilize the Site. This might include information regarding traffic patterns through the site and search queries. No IP address/log file information is tied to Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</p>
          <p>Third, we log browser types, access times, URLs from which visitors came to our Site, and URLs viewed by visitors while on our Site. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not provide this information to third parties, except in combined form.
          Our privacy statement does not cover the use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site.
          </p>
          <span>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</span>
          <p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar to cookies. They are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages. They are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>
          <span>Testimonials</span>
          <p>With your consent, we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you want your testimonial removed, please contact us.</p>

          <p>Our Site includes links to other Websites whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.</p>
          <span>Notification of the Changes in Privacy Policy</span>
          <p>Suppose we decide to change our privacy policy. In that case, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. Suppose we make material changes to this policy.

          <span>Legal Disclaimer</span>
          <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.</p>
          <span>Queries</span>
          <p>If you have any questions regarding our Privacy Policy or our use of your information, call our toll-free number <a href="tel:+17372630237"> +1 (737) 263-0237 </a>/ <a href="tel:+17139221311">+1 (713) 922-1311</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:support@elitedesignhub.com">support@elitedesignhub.com</a> / <a href="mailto:info@elitedesignhub.com">info@elitedesignhub.com</a>.</p>
