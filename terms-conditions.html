        <div class="PrivacyPolicy">
          <span>REVISION POLICY</span>
          <p>We provide revision depending upon the package you selected. Customers can ask us for an unlimited no. of edits, and we will revise their design without any additional charges, provided that the design and concept remain the same. Revision Turnaround Time would be 48 hours.</p>
          <span>Refund Policy / Money Back Guarantee</span>
          <p>In any event, any deposited funds for a project shall not be subject to refund after delivery if the initial design concepts are approved or a change is requested unless Grab Your Logo cancels or terminates your Contract for a reason other than your breach or non-performance:</p>
          <span>All refund requests will be fulfilled as per the following arrangement:</span>
          <ul>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> You make a request when the initial concepts for a website are offered. However, once you approve or request changes in the initial designs, the refund offer becomes void, and the refund request will not be entertained.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> If the request for a refund is made before delivering the initial design concepts, you would be eligible for a Full Refund (less than 10% service & processing fee).</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> If the request for a refund is made within 48 hours, you would be eligible for a 66% refund (excluding 10% service & processing fee).</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> If the refund request is made between 48- 120 hours of the initial design delivery, you would be eligible for a 33% refund (excluding 10% service & processing fee).</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> No refund request will be entertained after 120 hours of your initial design delivery. However, since we believe in 100% customer satisfaction, you're encouraged to contact us in case of any concern.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> No refund request will be entertained if you have not taken any action on your order for 30 days after placing your order. However, if you want to reactivate your design order, you will be charged a certain fee, depending on your project.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> No refund requests will be entertained after the final files have been delivered.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> No refund will be entertained for website packages once website development has been completed or once the website has been deployed live.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> No refund request will be entertained for video animation packages after the storyboard's design.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> All refund requests should be communicated to the support department. At The Grab Your Logo, based on the violation of your user agreement, reserves the right to approve/disapprove your request on an individual case to case basis.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> For The Grab Your Logo / Custom packages, a refund will be applicable the same as it is on the single packages.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> For example, if you order a website and web design service and approve the website, you can claim a refund for the website service at the time of initial design only.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> A refund request will need to have a valid reason which must be qualified against the design brief and customer feedback for revisions. Unless a concept has not been designed according to the brief, a refund will not be given; however, further modifications will be provided until complete satisfaction.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> A Money-back guarantee is based on the order placed in good faith. A customer has placed design orders with more than one design agency for the same job to claim a refund; we do not consider it a good faith. We reserve the right to decline a refund request in such a case.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> All design jobs require customer feedback before finalizing the design. Therefore, it is only fair that the customer gets involved and provides feedback to get the desired results.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> 100% unique design guarantee entitles you to a redraw if our designed website is to be found considerably similar to another website design that may already exist. Any resemblance to an existing structure will be merely a coincidence, and The Grab Your Logo will not accept any responsibility or claim of any compensation in such a case. It is the client's responsibility to get their artwork copyrighted.</li>            
          </ul>
